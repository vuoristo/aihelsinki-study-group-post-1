Linear Filters and Frequency Analysis
=====================================

This post is written as part of AIHelsinki study group on natural image statistics. This text mostly covers material from Natural Image Statistics book chapter 2 available [here](http://www.naturalimagestatistics.net/). The format of this post is something between learning diary and a summary but I tried to include some original examples with reproduction instructions in the text. The topics covered in this post are mostly the same as in the textbook chapter 2 including linear filtering, frequency analysis, and space-frequency analysis. Some material has been left out and there may be inaccuracies so please consider this post supplemental to the textbook chapter.

This post is also available on the [AIHelsinki blog](http://www.aihelsinki.com/risto-post/)

And a demonstration of the gabor filtering is available as a jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/vuoristo/gabor_demo)
